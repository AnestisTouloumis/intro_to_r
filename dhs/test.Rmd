## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE}
cars = read_csv("http://johnmuschelli.com/intro_to_r/data/kaggleCarAuction.csv")
mod = lm(VehBCost ~ VehicleAge * Size, data = cars)
tidy_mod = tidy(mod, conf.int = TRUE)
tidy_mod = tidy_mod %>% select(term, estimate, p.value)
pander::pander(tidy_mod)
```

```{r tab2, echo=TRUE, message = FALSE}
knitr::kable(tidy_mod) %>% kable_styling()
```

$$
y_i = x_{i} + \beta_1 + \varepsilon_{i}
$$

The $\beta_{0}$ estimate was `r round(mod$coefficients["(Intercept)"])`.  

```{r plot}
ggplot(aes(x = VehicleAge, y = VehBCost), data = cars) + 
  geom_point()
```

The mean age of the cars was `r round(mean(cars$VehicleAge), 1)`.

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
